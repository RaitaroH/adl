# adl

This is wrapper for ![vn-ki/anime-downloader](https://github.com/vn-ki/anime-downloader) + ![z411/trackma](https://github.com/z411/trackma). The goal? Type `adl`, hit enter, choose show, watch show, update episode number with as little input as possible. 

### Requirements:

+ anime-donwloader
+ trackma
+ fzf

### Features:

+ watch next episode of any show you have currently watching (I have it setup with anilist)
+ allow for updating the anime entry using trackma
+ it could also be expanded to do anything else using trackma's own functions

### Usage:

Download the script to `~/bin` or `~/.local/bin` and then simply type `adl` in your terminal.
