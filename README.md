[![All Contributors](https://img.shields.io/badge/all_contributors-1-orange.svg?style=flat-square)](#contributors-)

This is wrapper for [vn-ki/anime-downloader](https://github.com/vn-ki/anime-downloader) + [z411/trackma](https://github.com/z411/trackma). The goal? Type `adl`, hit enter, choose show, watch show, update episode number with as little input as possible.

### Features

+ fetch currently watching anime from your account;
+ option to change account used by trackma;
+ option to update local list;
+ select multiple anime to be watched in sequence;
+ watch any episode from the anime chosen, default is the next episode;
+ easily watch all available episodes after last watched, in order to catch up. Also update list accordingly;
+ prompt user for watching another show;
+ prompt user to add a score to an anime if the anime in question will be set as completed;
+ option to skip all user input - works in combination with the other options as well;
+ download instead of watching; everything from above still applies;
+ use local media instead of streaming. Requires identical folder name to anilist anime title, ex: `Fruits Basket: 2nd Season` should be a folder in `animedir` variable, otherwise `adl` will **not** find the anime folder. Considering random episode numbering, `fzf` is used for episode selecting.
+ do not display verbose vlc output;
+ warn user if episode wasn't found.

### Requirements

+ [vn-ki/anime-downloader](https://github.com/vn-ki/anime-downloader/wiki/Installation) - make sure this works. [Git version](https://github.com/vn-ki/anime-downloader/issues/226) required for `$adl -y`. Settings for `anime-downloader`, such as provider, need to be placed in your [configuration file](https://github.com/vn-ki/anime-downloader/wiki/Config), as instructed in the documentation.
+ [z411/trackma](https://github.com/z411/trackma) - tested with anilist (you need to set up trackma before using adl). Also adl now needs the following [PR merge](https://github.com/z411/trackma/commit/020c0a25637f7368e6c075bcbe67cd938a51b818) that fixes issue [#9](https://github.com/RaitaroH/adl/issues/9);
+ [junegunn/fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) - needed for show selection;
+ [frece](https://github.com/SicariusNoctis/frece) - *optional* - `$adl -f` will show most watched anime at the top of the list. By default frece is not used;
+ [MPV](https://mpv.io/) - used to play the anime (better integration with anime-downloader). [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/) can also be used: `$adl -p vlc`.

### Installation

Simply download the script in your `~/bin` folder and make it executable.

```
mkdir -p "$HOME/bin"
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RaitaroH/adl/master/adl -O "$HOME/bin/adl"
chmod +x "$HOME/bin/adl"
```
If you are using Arch Linux you can install from the [Arch Linux User Repository (AUR)](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/adl-git/) thanks to [@Baitinq](https://github.com/Baitinq).

### Updating

`adl` also has a function for updating itself from source. To use it run `adl -u` or `adl --update` and follow the prompts.

### Issues

If the show doesn't start for you, the script will inform you of this. If you are positive that the episode number has aired, then most likely the provider you are using is NOT yet up-to-date. If you want to try every provider to see where your show is hosted you can try this bash code to cycle through all of them.

```
adlwrap() {
  declare -a provider=(animepahe animeflix animefreak animeflv anistream gogoanime kissanime kisscartoon twist.moe itsaturday)
  for k in $provider; do
    printf "\n\033[0;31m%s\n" "PROVIDER: $k"
    anime dl "$1" --episodes "$2" --provider "$k" --play mpv
  done
}
```

The function above can be used like so: `$ adlwrap "SHOW" "EPISODE"`:

```
$ adlwrap "Gundam: The Origin" "1"
```

The providers there can be found with `anime dl --help`.
